The steel mills created a substantial number of jobs in the region. Many of the mills in and near Chicago consolidated in the early twentieth century to become a major corporation: U.S. Steel. As the owners of steel mills gained significant wealth, laborers in steel mills consistently organized for better working conditions starting in the late nineteenth century."
