Less arid than the far West and less dependent on cotton and slavery than the South, the Midwest proved crucial in producing crops and meat for growing urban populations in the United States and Europe. Emerging agricultural networks often provided economic benefit to owners of railroads, factories, and packing houses. At the same time, farmers in the Midwest routinely organized to maximize their own benefit and combat corporate power. The impact of industrial agriculture continues to shape the economic and cultural realities of farming into the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries."
